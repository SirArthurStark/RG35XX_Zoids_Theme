# RG35XX_Zoids_Theme
A Zoids-inspired theme I made for the Anbernic RG35XX

This is a theme that can be installed on GarlicOS for the RG35XX. It's completely customized, made to work best with the Tiny Best Set alternative artworks.

It includes a fully custom Zoids theme, together with two sets of system icons. One with orange font, which suits the theme best, and an alternative one with white font, that can suit most other themes really well.

I do not own any of the assets used here, this is a project made just for fun.
